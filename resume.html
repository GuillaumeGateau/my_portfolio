              The student rental market is complex: on/off campus residences, private apartments, room shares, exchanges and host families. Universities strive to ease the search so that students can concentrate on their courses. Unfortunately, the process requires sifting through dozens of websites with different profiles, personal/confidential information, without university oversight or security.
              <br><br>
              RoomActually proposes a platform that offers functionally rich interfaces for each actor. Housing departments converge all official and unofficial housing options into one portal. The university interface allows management of offerings with approval workflows. Students search and filter through offers, create a profile, achieve validation steps/add documents to improve their application. Residence logins provide channel management for shares, multi-room apartments, multi-tenant buildings and full student residences. Application management, room assignment and reservation are updated in real-time.
